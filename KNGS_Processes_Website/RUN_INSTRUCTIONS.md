# KNGS Email Progress Checker - Run Instructions

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using the Python Runner (Recommended)
```bash
python3 run_app.py
```

### Option 2: Using the Shell Script
```bash
./run_app.sh
```

## What This Does

The run script will:

1. **Start the Email Service** on port 5002
   - Handles Microsoft Graph API authentication
   - Provides email search functionality
   - Shows device code authentication prompts in the terminal

2. **Start the Electron App** with React development server
   - Automatically installs npm dependencies if needed
   - Opens the desktop application
   - Connects to the email service for email functionality

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+** with pip
- **Node.js 16+** with npm
- **Microsoft Azure App Registration** (already configured)

## First Time Setup

1. **Install Python Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Node.js Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python3 run_app.py
   ```

## How to Use the Application

### Step 1: Start the Application
Run the script and wait for both services to start:
```
üéØ KNGS Email Progress Checker - Starting Application
üöÄ Starting email service...
‚úÖ Email service started successfully on port 5002
üñ•Ô∏è  Starting Electron app...
‚úÖ Electron app started successfully
üéâ Application started successfully!
```

### Step 2: Upload Excel File
1. The Electron app will open automatically
2. Click "Upload File" and select your Excel spreadsheet
3. The app will parse employee data from the spreadsheet

### Step 3: Check Employee Progress
1. Go to the "Check Progress" tab
2. Search for an employee name
3. Click "Check Progress"

### Step 4: Authenticate with Microsoft Graph (First Time Only)
When you first check emails, you'll see:
```
üîê Authenticating with Microsoft Graph...
üì± Please check the terminal for device code instructions
```

In the terminal, you'll see something like:
```
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin 
and enter the code XXXXXXXXX to authenticate.
```

1. Open https://microsoft.com/devicelogin in your browser
2. Enter the displayed code
3. Sign in with your Microsoft account
4. Grant permissions to the application

### Step 5: View Results
After authentication, you'll see:
- **Employee Records**: All spreadsheet rows assigned to that employee
- **Related Emails**: Emails with the employee's name in the subject line
- **Email Details**: Sender, date, read status, attachments, and preview

## Features

### Email Search
- Searches for emails with employee name in subject line
- Shows read/unread status
- Displays email previews
- Indicates attachments with üìé icon
- Shows sender information and timestamps

### Data Integration
- Parses Excel spreadsheets automatically
- Matches employee names to email searches
- Shows ticket numbers and assignments
- Displays all relevant data columns

### Authentication
- **Single Sign-On**: Authenticate once per session
- **Token Caching**: Reuses authentication tokens
- **Device Code Flow**: Secure authentication without storing passwords

## Troubleshooting

### Email Service Issues
If you see "Email service is not running":
1. Check that port 5002 is not in use by another application
2. Restart the application
3. Check the terminal for error messages

### Authentication Issues
If authentication fails:
1. Make sure you have internet connectivity
2. Check that the device code hasn't expired (they expire after 15 minutes)
3. Try restarting the application for a fresh authentication

### Electron App Issues
If the Electron app doesn't open:
1. Check that Node.js and npm are installed
2. Run `npm install` manually if dependencies are missing
3. Check for port conflicts (React dev server uses port 3000)

## Stopping the Application

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop both services:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Keyboard interrupt received
üßπ Cleaning up...
‚úÖ Email service stopped
‚úÖ Electron app stopped
```

## Technical Details

### Ports Used
- **5002**: Email service API
- **3000**: React development server
- **Electron**: Desktop application (connects to port 3000)

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Service health check
- `GET /api/auth/user` - Get current user info
- `POST /api/emails/search` - Search emails by employee name

### File Structure
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_app.py              # Main application runner
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_app.sh              # Shell script wrapper
