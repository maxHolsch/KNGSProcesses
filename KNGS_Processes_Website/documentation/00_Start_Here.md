# Start Here - KNGS Email Progress Checker Documentation Guide

## Welcome! üëã

This is your starting point for understanding and using the KNGS Email Progress Checker. This guide will help you find exactly the documentation you need based on what you're trying to accomplish.

## What is the KNGS Email Progress Checker?

The KNGS Email Progress Checker is a desktop application that:
- Reads employee data from Excel spreadsheets
- Searches through our email inbox for employee-related communications
- Helps track employee progress by correlating Excel data with email activity

**Important**: This is a prototype application that I created with AI assistance. Do not deploy to production environments without proper review.

## Important Notes Before You Start

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a Prototype**: Once, again I want to stress that this application was created with AI assistance and is intended for testing and evaluation only. Do not deploy to production environments without thorough review and testing.

üîê **Microsoft Account Required**: You'll need a Microsoft account (work or personal) to use the email search features. I think this will need to be enterprise level, and would need to be carefully discussed with IT before it could be integrated

üìä **Excel File Format**: Your Excel files must have a specific format, similar to the standarized RO Tracker. See the [User Guide](./05_User_Guide.md) for details.

üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop Application**: This is a desktop app that runs on Windows, Mac, or Linux - not a web application.
